- Deal with NAN data

- Goal: 
    - Find whether Tree or Graph was a better Ontology for the experiment based on `ScanPath` and `Scores` for each user.


- Create Visualization (Most likely Scatter Plot):
    - Comparing Tree and Graph, therefore both should be present on the plot.
        - Differentiate with coloring 
    - Slider for score ranges: 
        - Display only the users who scored within Range to minimize the amount of Data in the Frame at one instance.
    - X-axis -> ScanPath Length
    - Y-axis -> Score Range 
    - Hover over each Point -> Average Saccade Length
